# Description
A multi-tenant feature flag service.

Currently, only the Redis backend is supported.
User information, including tenant ID, is stored in a Postgres database. Each tenant is mapped to a Redis node.

# Docker
Everything is Dockerized, so you can run the following command to spin the application up quickly:

#+begin_src bash
  # To only spin up Redis and Postgres services
  docker-compose up -d redis db

  # Run local webserver
  cargo run

  # Run all services, web UI on :8080
  docker-compose up
#+end_src

# Clients

# TODO
- Support different backends other than Redis
